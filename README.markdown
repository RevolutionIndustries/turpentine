Add Varnish support to your Ruby on Rails Application.

* Write Edge Side Includes using standard redner partials syntax
* Automatic Varnish detection for use in dev and production
* Clear Varnish cache using BAN and PURGE requests
* Render ESI's using a multi-request like flow that still displays correctly for development
